<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Logpile web project.</h3>

<p>The purpose of this projects is to in only one repository collect all the errors of your application java and treat them : grouping all your applications in one and only log, store them, email them, etc  ....</p>

<h3>Why this framework ?</h3>
<p>
	Bescause :
	<ul>
		<li>The majority of other solution is complex to install.</li>
		<li>The majority of your enterprise application are written in java. Your developpers know the java language. You  want a little product for spying the state of your applications in production. This project must be an good start for inspiration.</li>
		<li>It's fun to developp applications with the latest technology : bootstrap, vertx, couchbase, etc ...</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The workflow is very simple :</p>
<ol>
<li> One application produce an error.</li>
<li> The connector of the logpile client catch the error.</li>
<li> The connector send the information on the error to a Logpile server.</li>
<li> This server receives the 'event' and do a configured work on it.</li>
   <u> Example :</u> send an email for warning the developpement team, write to a single file the error, etc</li>
</ol>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>This project is composed of three sub project :</p>
<ul>
<li>the client : It's a small jar which provide appenders for log framework in java. The documentation is in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/client">client section</a></li>
<li>the server : it's a tiny application which collects errors provided by the appenders. The documentation is in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/server"> Server section</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An example client project is available ( Doc in <a  href="client/example.html" >client/Example section</a>).</p>
<p> Two vertx mods were created for the server side management :
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modvertx/mod-couchbase.html">A module for couchbase database.</a></li>
<li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modvertx/mod-jmx.html">A mod for exporting jmx data via the vertx eventbus.</a></li>
